`A Google Doc for sharing today <http://bit.ly/FengGoogleDoc>`__

Preparation
-----------

**Read**

`Interactive notebooks: Sharing the code by Helen Shen. Nature. 2014 Nov
6;515(7525):151-2. doi: 10.1038/515151a. PMID:
25373681 <http://www.nature.com/news/interactive-notebooks-sharing-the-code-1.16261>`__

UPDATE: now I'd probably add `Programming: Pick up Python by Jeffrey M.
Perkel. Nature. 2015 February 5;518:125â€“6.doi:10.1038/518125a.
PMID:25653001 <http://www.nature.com/news/programming-pick-up-python-1.16833>`__
too

**Tech prep**

Be sure you have a modern, updated browser on your system. Preferably
Chrome or Firefox.

Register and do the follow-up activation at
`SourceLair <https://www.sourcelair.com/>`__.

Register for `Sagemath Cloud <https://cloud.sagemath.com>`__.

Be sure to have a good text editor on your computer. Sounds like you may
have been using AquaMac in the past and so this shouldn't be a problem.
I highly recommend `Sublime Text <http://www.sublimetext.com/>`__.
However, for what we'll be doing Thursday, even TextWrangler on a Mac
will be sufficient. For those not on a Mac, I'd recommend `Sublime
Text <http://www.sublimetext.com/>`__ or
`Notepad++ <http://notepad-plus-plus.org/>`__ or jEdit.

Intro to technology
-------------------

We'll use as a group two technologies today.

-  `SourceLair <https://www.sourcelair.com/>`__

-  `Sagemath Cloud <https://cloud.sagemath.com>`__

The idea for using cloud-based tools is to make it easier upfront to get
coding and then you can modify what you use as you develop your coding
workflow preferences. (Sorry for needing two, but finding a good
interface that has all the features desired and works on the Upstate
network is not easy.)
