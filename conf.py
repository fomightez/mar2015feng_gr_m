# conf.py that works with my approach of using pandoc to convert markdown text
# to restrctured text. It was created by taking the file version # cd20cc5 at
# https://github.com/rtfd/readthedocs.org/blob/master/docs/conf.py and removing
# all the lines that didn't pertain to my files that I could see. Then I deleted
# the lines that caused the builds to fail one by one until it worked.
#
# Impetus was that I was looking for a way to have the copyright set properly
# but allow my normal (hack) approach to making the `.rst` files for sphinx work.
