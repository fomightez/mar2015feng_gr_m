========

Partial List of the Acronyms in ChIP-related Work
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

ChIP-seq : chromatin immunoprecipitation ("ChIP") coupled with high
throughput sequencing

ChIP-chip or ChIP-on-chip : chromatin immunoprecipitation ("ChIP") with
DNA microarray ("chip").

MeDip : Methylated DNA immunoprecipitation

high throughput sequencing

DNase-seq : high throughput sequencing of DNase I-digested DNA

CC-seq : Chemical cleavage coupled with high throughput sequencing

PE : Paired-end

SR : Single read

R-ChIP : robotic ChIP

Native ChIP (N-ChIP) vs. X-ChIP (typical ChIP where crosslinked)

ChIP-exo : chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) combined with lambda
exonuclease digestion followed by high-throughput sequencing
