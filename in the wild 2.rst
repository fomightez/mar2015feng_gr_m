Examples from the Wild 2: IPython Notebooks
===========================================

NGS Analysis of ChIP-seq data using IPython Notebooks to Explore
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`Determining Average ChIP-seq signal over promoters with
Metaseq <http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/daler/metaseq/blob/v0.5dev/doc/source/example_session.ipynb>`__
> This example demonstrates the use of :mod:metaseq for performing a
common task when analyzing ChIP-seq data: what is the average signal
over transcription start sites (TSS) throughout the genome?

That looks interesting but what framework is being used to make and host
this?

So what are ``IPython Notebooks``?

Allows you to code interactively in your browser and take advantage of
all the aspects of HTML and other special web features, including
sharing online

These are especially useful for exploring data and developing code or
developing approaches to analyzing your data.

`Titus Brown's
screencast <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaS4NXxL5Qc&feature=youtu.be>`__
and associated notebook illustrates much of this.

I'll show two other notebooks I have made and show them interactively.

Q: You've run your notebook and populated the cells, now how can you
share it with colleagues? A: If you follow these steps you or anyone
else you share it with can see your notebook on the web.

-  Upload your notebook code to somewhere. Github or simply even as a
   Gist will work fine.

-  Place the ``URL`` `here <http://nbviewer.ipython.org/>`__ and click
   'Go!'

Note that the notebooks shared in this form will not be interactive. You
can though download them and run them locally.

The future ...
''''''''''''''

The IPython Notebooks concept goes beyond Python and now they are
developing a language-agnostic version of the Notebook as the `Jupyter
Project <http://jupyter.org/>`__ project.

Back to Metaseq
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The page `here <https://github.com/daler/metaseq>`__ actually has a
legend with some of the plots that describes additionally apects of the
exploratory analyses done on the page `Determing Average ChIP-seq signal
over promoters with
Metaseq <http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/daler/metaseq/blob/v0.5dev/doc/source/example_session.ipynb>`__.
