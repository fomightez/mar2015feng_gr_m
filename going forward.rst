   in running it on Amazon web services right now.) A non-interactive

###Learning R

Learning Python
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  `A hands-on introduction to Python for beginning
   programmers <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkx5_MRAV3A>`__

-  `Rosalind, platform for learning bioinformatics and programming
   through problem solving <http://rosalind.info/problems/locations/>`__

-  `A modern guide to getting started with Data Science and
   Python <http://twiecki.github.io/blog/2014/11/18/python-for-data-science/>`__

-  `How to Think Like a Computer Scientist: Learning with Python
   2.x <http://www.openbookproject.net/thinkcs/python/english2e/>`__

-  `How to Think Like a Computer Scientist: Learning with Python
   3.x <http://openbookproject.net/thinkcs/python/english3e/index.html>`__

-  `Bioinf-py <http://hplgit.github.io/bioinf-py/doc/web/index.html>`__

-  The three Coursera courses in Rice University's Fundamentals of
   Computing specialization. The three courses are `An Introduction to
   Interactive Programming in
   Python <https://www.coursera.org/course/interactivepython>`__,
   `Principles of
   Computing <https://www.coursera.org/course/principlescomputing>`__,
   and `Algorithmic
   Thinking <https://www.coursera.org/course/algorithmicthink>`__ By the
   third you are learning little to no new Python and focusing on
   designing and writing efficient algorithmns, which is useful too. One
   of the instructors, Luay Nakhleh, focuses on bioinformatics, and so
   while they touch on some of these aspects later in the series of
   courses, the main emphasis is computing in general.

-  Coursera course: `Programming for Everybody
   (Python) <https://www.coursera.org/course/pythonlearn>`__ - Gradually
   paced introduction to coding essentials using Python

-  `Dive Into Python <http://www.diveintopython.net/>`__

-  `Bioinformatics and Genomics: IPython and the Systems Biology
   Knowledgebase <https://bcrc.bio.umass.edu/courses/spring2012/micbio/micbio660/content/ipython-and-systems-biology-knowledgebase-kbase>`__

-  `The Python
   Tutorial <https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/index.html>`__

-  `Python for Biologists <http://pythonforbiologists.com/>`__

-  `CodeAcademy <http://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/python>`__

-  `Think Python: How to Think Like a Computer
   Scientist <http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkpython/>`__

-  `“Why We Built Enthought Canopy, An Inside Look” Recorded
   Webinar <http://blog.enthought.com/general/why-we-built-canopy/#.VLNDKWTF85g>`__

-  `The GOBLET Training Portal: A Global Repository of Bioinformatics
   Training Materials, Courses and
   Trainers <http://mygoblet.org/training-portal>`__, see `abstract of
   associated
   publication <http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2014/09/03/bioinformatics.btu601.abstract>`__

-  Keep in mind that Enthought advertises they have free online courses
   for individuals at degree-granting institutions. the `twitter
   posting <https://twitter.com/enthought/status/566602865196945408>`__
   said see `here <https://training.enthought.com/courses>`__. (Although
   I didn't see anything about them being free but maybe it is shown
   after you register with academic email account?)
